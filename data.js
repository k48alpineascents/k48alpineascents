The natural dynamics of this fluid makes that this display bridges the gap between everyday digital screens and tangible reality.\n \n Because the fluid behaves in an unpredictable way, it is possible to give the bodies, perceived in the Ferrolic display, a strong reference to living creatures. It is this livelihood that enables Ferrolic to show a meaningful narrative such as having the creatures play tag. In addition the natural flow of the material, Ferrolic can be used to form recognisable shapes and written characters. Ferrolic uses both information-layers in parallel in order to display scenes and transitions in a poetic, almost dance like, choregraphed way.</p>\n <p>Dimensions: 8 x 1.5 x 2.4 inches</p>\n <p>made by Zelf Koelman</p>"
